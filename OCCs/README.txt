Export data to Excel.

3dviewer comes from :
    https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-demos/blob/master/examples/ifc_clip_plane.py
Have everyting in main.py at the moment cause error of variable loop (variables in the displays uses in the def so the need to be in same) and havnt had time to solve it yet.
